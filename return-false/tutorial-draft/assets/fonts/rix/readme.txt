Some tips to get crisp text in Flash:

- Text align at left;

- If you want to align text at right use 0.25 px in the right margin;

- 8 points font size (or 16, 32, ...);

- DON'T use bold or italic;

- ALL integer values:
 
	- Positions (x: 15.0 and y: 15.0 instead of x: 15.3 and y: 15.7);

	- Do the same with line spacing and character spacing;

- Position your movieclip's origin at the top-left corner;

- And don't forget to embed the font in Input and Dynamic Text fields.

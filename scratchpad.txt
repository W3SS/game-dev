# Notes on the flow of actions:
#
# On initial click:
	# _on_click -> start_interaction -> check_branches ->
	# end_interaction OR present_conversations
# From present_conversations:
	# create_branch_option -> enter_branch
	# (Branch and MessageUI handle it from there)


	
	# Here's how we could jump right into the topic:
	# var branch = dialog_branches[0]
	# enter_branch(branch)

	# ...but instead we'll ease into it
	# and treat it like we would treat multiple options
